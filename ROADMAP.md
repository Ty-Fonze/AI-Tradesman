# AI-Tradesman Roadmap

## **1. Vision & Overview**

**Ultimate Vision:** 
> “I want my AI to be my one-stop shop for everything on the market, acting as a teacher, mentor, and assistant.”

**Core Purpose:** 
Leverage the power of AI to harness every available tool for a comprehensive trading assistant that helps scan markets, provide educational insights, manage your portfolio, and dynamically interact with you through a customizable desktop application.

---

## **2. Core Functionalities**

- **Market Scanning & Technical Analysis:** 
  - Continuously scan multiple stocks/assets using a suite of technical indicators (RSI, MACD, moving averages, Bollinger Bands, support/resistance levels, and recognizable chart patterns such as head-and-shoulders, double tops/bottoms, etc.).
  - Generate actionable trade signals including potential entry and exit points.
  - Simulate scenarios (e.g., “what if price drops by 5%”) for more informed decisions.

- **Real-Time News & Sentiment Analysis:** 
  - Integrate live news feeds and perform sentiment analysis to gauge market mood.
  - Alert you with contextual information whenever significant news or trends affect the market.

- **Educational & Trading Mentor Features:** 
  - Offer in-depth explanations and trading tips—acting as an on-demand mentor to guide strategy refinement.
  - Provide interactive educational modules that explain the rationale behind suggestions.

- **Portfolio Management & Performance Feedback:** 
  - Display current positions, profit/loss, risk exposures, and historical performance data.
  - Allow the AI to analyze your portfolio and offer real-time feedback on trade outcomes, rebalancing needs, or strategy adjustments.

- **Dynamic, Interactive UI & Visualization:** 
  - A desktop app featuring a vast array of widgets (daily summary, live market scanning, interactive charts, news feeds, portfolio performance, etc.) that you can freely move, resize, and customize across multiple monitors.
  - Enable the AI to autonomously interact with these widgets—repositioning or highlighting data as necessary.

- **Advanced Capabilities & Additional Tools:** 
  - Support alerts and customizable notifications for specific criteria (e.g., indicator threshold breaches).
  - Plan for future integration of advanced scenario simulations and behavioral analytics.

## **3. Data Infrastructure**

- **Real-Time Data Requirement:** 
  The system must rely on real-time market data. Although Yahoo Finance is familiar, real-time criticality means moving to a provider that offers minimal delay.

- **Chosen Data Provider:** 
  **IEX Cloud:** 
  - Offers a free tier with real-time data for U.S. equities.
  - Low-cost option suitable for ensuring near-instant market updates.

- **Data Ingestion & Frequency:** 
  - **Goal:** Near real-time streaming with the quickest updates possible.
  - **Acceptable Trade-off:** A slight delay (a few seconds) is acceptable if imposed by free-tier limitations.
  - **Setup:** Utilize IEX Cloud APIs for continuous data ingestion with periodic checks for latency and quality.

---

## **4. Technical Analysis & Market Scanning Modules**

- **Indicator Integration:** 
  - Focus on including a robust set of technical indicators (RSI, MACD, moving averages, Bollinger Bands, trend lines, support/resistance zones, etc.).
  - Leverage open-source code and existing libraries to incorporate these indicators efficiently.

- **Market Scanning:** 
  - The AI should automatically scan multiple assets and flag potential trading opportunities based on indicator readings.
  - Generate a comprehensive dashboard or list: For each flagged opportunity, details will include risk assessments, simulated scenarios, and suggested entry & exit signals.

---

## **5. User Interface (UI) & Desktop Application Development**

- **Interface Vision:** 
  - A dynamic, widget-driven desktop application.
  - Widgets are moveable, resizable, and can be arranged across multiple monitors to suit your needs.

- **Key UI Components & Widgets:** 
  - **Daily Summary Widget:** Provides an overview of market predictions and key events each morning.
  - **Live Market Scanning Widget:** Continuously updates with flagged trading opportunities and alerts.
  - **Interactive Chart Widget:** Displays candlestick charts, overlays technical indicators, allows annotations, and even simulates price movements.
  - **News & Sentiment Widget:** Aggregates live news feeds and sentiment data.
  - **Educational/Mentor Widget:** Offers trading tips, educational content, and strategy guidance.
  - **Portfolio Widget:** Shows portfolio performance and enables interactive feedback from the AI, including performance reviews and trading suggestions.

- **Interactive AI Integration:** 
  - The AI can autonomously rearrange, highlight, or bring forward widgets when certain market conditions are met.
  - Enable both automated insights and manual exploration via direct user interaction.

- **Framework Considerations:** 
  - Options include Electron (for cross-platform JavaScript-based apps) or GUI toolkits like PyQt (for Python-based solutions).

---

## **6. AI Integration & Multi-AI Collaboration**

- **Central "Boss" Model:** 
  - A central orchestrator handles high-level decisions—delegating tasks to specialized AI models (e.g., NLP for educational insights, predictive analytics for trade forecasts, sentiment analysis for news).

- **Delegation & Aggregation:** 
  - The governor model assesses which specialized model is best for a given task, then aggregates and provides a unified output.
  - Initially, this can serve as a starting point, with opportunities to refine the orchestration mechanism as the project evolves.

- **Model Interaction:** 
  - Ensure each model outputs its analytics to a centralized dashboard.
  - Handle conflicting signals by either prioritizing trust in one model or flagging multiple outcomes in the UI for further review.

---

## **7. Testing, Quality Assurance & Deployment**

- **Automated Testing:** 
  - Write unit tests for individual modules (data ingestion, technical analysis, UI interactions, and AI insights).
  - Configure comprehensive integration tests to ensure proper communication between modules.
  - Utilize a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run tests on every commit, ensuring continuous quality control.

- **Manual Testing & User Acceptance:** 
  - Regularly perform manual tests, especially for the UI and subtle AI decision-making.
  - Schedule user acceptance testing (UAT) sessions to ensure that the system meets usage expectations.

- **Deployment Process:** 
  - **Packaging:** Create executable builds using tools like Electron-packager (for Electron apps) or PyInstaller (for Python applications).
  - **Monitoring:** Set up logging and performance dashboards that report on system functionality and potential issues in real time.

---

## **8. Iteration, Feedback & Self-Healing Mechanism**

- **Self-Healing System:** 
  - **Daily Evaluation:** The system will run an automated self-review at least once a day, comparing predicted outcomes with actual market performance.
  - **Feedback-Driven Adjustments:** Use these evaluations to automatically fine-tune and recalibrate predictive models. 
  - **Reinforcement Learning:** Consider adaptive learning approaches where the system gradually improves based on historical accuracy.
  - **Logging & Alerts:** Detailed performance logs and automated error alerts will help diagnose issues for immediate auto-corrections as needed.

- **Continuous Improvement Cycle:** 
  - In addition to automated efforts, plan periodic manual reviews (e.g., weekly or monthly) to validate that the self-healing improvements remain effective.

---

## **9. Documentation & Project Management on GitHub**

- **Repository Structure:** 
  - **Documentation:** Maintain detailed documentation in Markdown files (e.g., `ROADMAP.md`, `requirements.md`, etc.) outlining all aspects of the project.
  - **Project Boards & Issues:** 
    - Utilize GitHub Project Boards (Kanban style) and issue tracking to prioritize tasks, manage milestones, and track progress.
  - **AI Assistance:** 
    - The AI helping develop this project will have access to these documents, ensuring it can review, update, and suggest improvements over time.
