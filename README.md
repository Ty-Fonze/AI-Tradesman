## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Install Python (‚â• 3.8) and Node.js (‚â• 14.x).
2. Obtain API keys from stock data providers (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance).
3. Ensure that a Redis server is running locally or remotely.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ty-Fonze/AI-Tradesman.git
   cd AI-Tradesman
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > **Note**: The `yfinance` library is included in the `requirements.txt` file and is used to fetch stock market data with a slight delay (up to 15 minutes for the free tier).

3. Install additional dependencies for real-time monitoring:
   ```bash
   pip install -r src/realtime_data/requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd src/dashboard
   npm install
   ```

5. Configure API keys:
   - Copy `config/api_keys_template.json` to `config/api_keys.json`.
   - Add your API keys.

6. Run the backend:
   ```bash
   python src/dashboard/app.py
   ```

7. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd src/dashboard
   npm start
   ```

## üí° Usage

### Real-Time Monitoring
The Redis-based real-time monitoring module fetches live stock data, stores it in Redis, and triggers alerts based on predefined thresholds.

1. Start the monitoring script:
   ```bash
   python src/realtime_data/main.py
   ```
   - This will fetch stock data periodically and store it in Redis.

2. Check for alerts:
   - Alerts will be printed to the console if a stock price exceeds a threshold.
   - Example:
     ```
     üö® Alert: AAPL price is above 175 -> 176.5
     ```

3. Verify Redis storage:
   - Use `redis-cli` to inspect stored data:
     ```bash
     redis-cli
     keys *
     ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Fetching and Database

### Data Fetching with Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)
The system uses the `yfinance` library as its primary data provider for stock market data. Note that the data may have a 15-minute delay due to Yahoo Finance's limitations in the free tier.

- **Historical Data**: The script fetches historical stock data using `yfinance` and stores it in a local SQLite database (`tradesman.db`).
- **Real-Time Data**: Real-time stock data is fetched and stored in Redis for fast access and periodic updates.

### Example Usage
Here‚Äôs an example of how to fetch and store historical data programmatically:
```python
from src.historical_data.historical_data import fetch_and_store_data

# Fetch and store data for Apple stock from 2022 to 2023
fetch_and_store_data("AAPL", "2022-01-01", "2023-01-01")
```

To simulate real-time updates:
```python
from src.historical_data.historical_data import simulate_realtime

simulate_realtime("AAPL")
```
