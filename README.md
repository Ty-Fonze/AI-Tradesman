## üí° Usage

### Real-Time Monitoring
The Redis-based real-time monitoring module fetches live stock data, stores it in Redis, and triggers alerts based on thresholds.

1. Start the monitoring script:
   ```bash
   python src/realtime_data/main.py
   ```
   
2. Check for alerts:
   - Alerts will be printed to the console if a stock price exceeds a threshold.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     üö® Alert: AAPL price is above 175 -> 176.5
     ```

3. Verify Redis storage:
   - Use `redis-cli` to inspect stored data:
     ```bash
     redis-cli
     keys *
     ```
